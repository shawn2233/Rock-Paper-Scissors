One of my favorite childhood games, Rock-Paper-Scissiors. You're able to go agaist the computer and see if you win. After clicking your choice,
the computer will tell you if you win, lose or tie ! Have fun !


How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Framework of choice

This is one of the first projects I ever created and I'm happy with it. One day I would like to make another and change the theme, maybe add pictures instead of the buttons!
